End nodes of a pervasive computing is not only desktop or laptop computers but also it includes cellphone devices, sensors, actuators, home appliances, wearable devices etc. An emerging application of pervasive computing is internet of things (IoT). Pervasive computing is also referred to as ubiquitous computing. b. Context aware network nodes have to be context aware in order to optimize performance. Distributed the system should be deployed over a distributed network. Autonomous network nodes should be self-governed, should be able to operate without human intervention. HCI human-computer interactions (HCI) should be minimized and hidden. Intelligent the network nodes should be intelligent i.e., artificial intelligence should be integrated.",
